# Booth's Binary Multiplier

Welcome to **Booth's Binary Multiplier**, a modern and responsive web application designed to multiply signed binary numbers using Booth's algorithm. This project showcases the elegance of computer arithmetic through an interactive interface, blending technical precision with innovative design.

## About Me
Hi, I’m Shukla Harsh, a second-year engineering student at Shri Ramswaroop Memorial University. Passionate about computer organization and architecture, I’m driven to explore how systems work at their core and develop creative solutions that push the boundaries of technology. This project is a step in my journey to merge coding, design, and hardware concepts into impactful tools.

## Project Overview
This web application implements Booth's multiplication algorithm to compute the product of two signed binary numbers in two’s complement notation. It provides results in both decimal and Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) formats, making it a valuable educational and practical tool for students and tech enthusiasts.
