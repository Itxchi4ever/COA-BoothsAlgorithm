                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’m Shukla Harsh, a second-year engineering student at Shri Ramswaroop Memorial University, where I’m forging my path in the world of technology with relentless curiosity and ambition. My passion lies at the intersection of innovation and engineering, particularly in the realm of computer organization and architecture—where the magic of hardware meets the elegance of code.</p>
                <p>Driven by a desire to push boundaries, I thrive on developing innovative ideas that solve real-world problems. From designing efficient algorithms like Booth’s multiplication to crafting modern web applications, I’m captivated by how systems work under the hood and how they can be optimized for performance and creativity. This project is a testament to my journey—blending technical precision with a vision for impactful solutions.</p>
                <p>When I’m not immersed in code or exploring processor designs, you’ll find me brainstorming new concepts, collaborating with peers, or diving into the latest advancements in tech. My goal? To engineer a future where innovation knows no limits.</p>
